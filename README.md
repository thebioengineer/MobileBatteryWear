Wear app to monitor phone battery

This Android Wear app is to view the battery level on your phone from your android wear device. I have found it is frustrating for me to be recieving texts and what not through my wear device, and not know how much longer my phone needs to be charging. Usually because the charger is in the other room, etc.  This may be the epitome of laziness, but I thought it would be a fun thing to have. 

It currently works, and am figuring out how to add it to the android market.

do to:
  -send an alarm to the wear to inform the user that the phone is fully charged if set to watch

Feedback and suggestions are appreciated!
